It was the first quilt I had made in quite a while, and I did not have many fabrics, but my partner bought me some pink and blue fabrics from Lidl and then I found a yellow fabric to brighten it up some more. Because I had not quilted in quite a bit, I wanted to do a sampler type quilt so I could get back into making lots of different patchwork blocks, lots of my old favourites including churn dash and the old windmill. For the white background of the blocks, I used an old sheet, I wouldn\u2019t recommend this as it was quite thin and I wonder if it will stand the test of time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the bears I drew them out first on paper to get the right size then bond-a-webbed and appliqu\u00e9d them onto the pillow fabric with a zig-zag stich. I hand sewed the eyes and mouths of the parents with a 6-strand embroidery thread.
