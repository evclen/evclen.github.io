The unicorn is a pattern by Elizabeth Hartman (<a href=\"https:\/\/elizabethhartman.com\/\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https:\/\/elizabethhartman.com\/\">https:\/\/elizabethhartman.com\/<\/a>) and I added some star of hope 6 inch blocks and some squares of unicorn fabric to make it bigger along with a nice border of rainbow stary fabric. The finished size is around a metre square. It&#8217;s not possible to tell from the photo but the horn is done with glittery fabric! I found a lovely line of unicorn fabric called Believe by Kim Schaefer and found fabrics from my stash and from the shop to go with them. The photo below shows the star Believe fabric layed out with the fabrics I chose to do the unicorn mane in. The rainbow is fairly pastely and an interesting combination of colours, it was fun to find fabrics to go with it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/quilting-clenpot\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/unicorn-fabric-1024x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-134\" width=\"512\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost\/quilting-clenpot\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/unicorn-fabric-1024x1024.jpeg 1024w, http:\/\/localhost\/quilting-clenpot\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/unicorn-fabric-300x300.jpeg 300w, http:\/\/localhost\/quilting-clenpot\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/unicorn-fabric-150x150.jpeg 150w, http:\/\/localhost\/quilting-clenpot\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/unicorn-fabric-768x768.jpeg 768w, http:\/\/localhost\/quilting-clenpot\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/unicorn-fabric-1536x1536.jpeg 1536w, http:\/\/localhost\/quilting-clenpot\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/unicorn-fabric-800x800.jpeg 800w, http:\/\/localhost\/quilting-clenpot\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/unicorn-fabric.jpeg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of my favourite fabrics in this quilt include a blue fabric with rainbows and a constellation pink fabric. I thought these were quite appropriate for a unicorn quilt and hope that the owner enjoys them as much as I did. I wonder if they will see something different in the quilt every time they snuggle under it, I like to try to hide little things in quilts which can&#8217;t be seen unless you really look at it deeply.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I quilted this quilt using stich in the ditch around the unicorn and the star border then added some machined stars in navy on the background for extra security. The backing fabric is a super vibrant flowery print which I really didn&#8217;t buy enough of so had to do a few joins to make it work but it was definitely worth it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/quilting-clenpot\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/unicornBack-1024x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-88\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost\/quilting-clenpot\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/unicornBack-1024x1024.jpeg 1024w, http:\/\/localhost\/quilting-clenpot\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/unicornBack-300x300.jpeg 300w, http:\/\/localhost\/quilting-clenpot\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/unicornBack-150x150.jpeg 150w, http:\/\/localhost\/quilting-clenpot\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/unicornBack-768x768.jpeg 768w, http:\/\/localhost\/quilting-clenpot\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/unicornBack-1536x1536.jpeg 1536w, http:\/\/localhost\/quilting-clenpot\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/unicornBack-800x800.jpeg 800w, http:\/\/localhost\/quilting-clenpot\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/unicornBack.jpeg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This quilt I made for a young girl who loves unicorns.
