I thought I would make my own, as I wanted a long project and had the perfect fabric for it. I had spotted this rainbow Alison Glass collection called &#8220;Thicket&#8221; and asked my family if they might buy me the fabric bundle for my birthday so that I could make this quilt. To go with it, we picked out a bluey teal linen texture fabric that would act as the background fabric.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"360\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/quilting-clenpot\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/signal-2023-06-22-120017_004copy-1024x360.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-231\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost\/quilting-clenpot\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/signal-2023-06-22-120017_004copy-1024x360.jpeg 1024w, http:\/\/localhost\/quilting-clenpot\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/signal-2023-06-22-120017_004copy-300x106.jpeg 300w, http:\/\/localhost\/quilting-clenpot\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/signal-2023-06-22-120017_004copy-768x270.jpeg 768w, http:\/\/localhost\/quilting-clenpot\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/signal-2023-06-22-120017_004copy-1536x540.jpeg 1536w, http:\/\/localhost\/quilting-clenpot\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/signal-2023-06-22-120017_004copy.jpeg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">The fabrics all lined up in order, ready to create an ombre quilt.

The square would be made from coloured fabric and the circle from the blue linen texture backing fabric. I would use hand quilting thread for sewing, which is thicker than normal thread and also has a shine which helps the stitching stand out. I bought a rainbow of different colours of these threads and will be using a coloured thread that will match the inside square.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/quilting-clenpot\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/signal-2023-06-22-133001_002-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-232\" width=\"429\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost\/quilting-clenpot\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/signal-2023-06-22-133001_002-1024x768.jpeg 1024w, http:\/\/localhost\/quilting-clenpot\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/signal-2023-06-22-133001_002-300x225.jpeg 300w, http:\/\/localhost\/quilting-clenpot\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/signal-2023-06-22-133001_002-768x576.jpeg 768w, http:\/\/localhost\/quilting-clenpot\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/signal-2023-06-22-133001_002-1536x1152.jpeg 1536w, http:\/\/localhost\/quilting-clenpot\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/signal-2023-06-22-133001_002.jpeg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 429px) 100vw, 429px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">My practise block now hangs on my sewing peg board<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I played around with different ombre designs on my computer to try to come up with the design my requirements were that the quilt needed to fit on a double bed so no less than 75 inches square which would be 15 by 15 blocks. Another requirement was to use all the fabrics in my pile.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"240\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/quilting-clenpot\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/Untitled1-1024x240.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-233\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost\/quilting-clenpot\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/Untitled1-1024x240.png 1024w, http:\/\/localhost\/quilting-clenpot\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/Untitled1-300x70.png 300w, http:\/\/localhost\/quilting-clenpot\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/Untitled1-768x180.png 768w, http:\/\/localhost\/quilting-clenpot\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/Untitled1-1536x360.png 1536w, http:\/\/localhost\/quilting-clenpot\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/Untitled1-2048x480.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Some different ideas about layout<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In the end, I decided to do a zigzag design. I had too many fabrics to simply have one line of zigzag for each colour, so would need to change colour part way along the zigzag. To get the right ratio of each colour, I figured out how many blocks I would need (256) and then planned how many blocks of each fabric I would use based on how many other fabrics of similar colour I had. For example, I had a lot of greens of a similar shade so would only cut 6 blocks of each green fabric, however I didn&#8217;t have many different yellows so might need 15 blocks of the same fabric.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1012\" height=\"620\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/quilting-clenpot\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/squares1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-235\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost\/quilting-clenpot\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/squares1.png 1012w, http:\/\/localhost\/quilting-clenpot\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/squares1-300x184.png 300w, http:\/\/localhost\/quilting-clenpot\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/squares1-768x471.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1012px) 100vw, 1012px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">My plan includes the number of squares of each fabric and how they will be laid out.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This will be a long project, but I am nearly a quarter of the way though and so far it is looking stunning.
