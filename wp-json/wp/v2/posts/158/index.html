It was a Japanese-inspired quilt made of fabric panels of geisha and large blocks made from Japanese fabric. She loves it, but it is an odd shape and does not fit the double bed she now has. I offered to make her and her fianc\u00e9e a new one and hoped to have it ready in time for a wedding present. I hoped to combine all the quilting skills I have developed to make a masterpiece.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gabby and I made a joint Pinterest board, this was so that I could see what sort of quilt she might like. The general ideas that I took from the board was a that Gabby wanted a light coloured, modern quilt with reasonably plain fabrics and not too many different colours. A few examples of quilts on the board are these 3 from Suzy Quilts, the thrive quilt <a href=\"https:\/\/suzyquilts.com\/shop\/thrive-quilt-pattern-download\/\">https:\/\/suzyquilts.com\/shop\/thrive-quilt-pattern-download\/<\/a>, the new horizons quilt <a href=\"https:\/\/suzyquilts.com\/shop\/new-horizons-quilt-pattern-download\/\">https:\/\/suzyquilts.com\/shop\/new-horizons-quilt-pattern-download\/<\/a> and an ombre quilt <a href=\"https:\/\/suzyquilts.com\/create-an-ombre-quilt-with-fat-quarters\/\">https:\/\/suzyquilts.com\/create-an-ombre-quilt-with-fat-quarters\/<\/a>. I would say that I was more of a traditional quilter so looked forward to the challenge of trying a more modern quilt.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would have liked to take Gabby to the fabric shop while she was up visiting, but we just didn\u2019t have time, so I got her to pick some fabrics from my stash. I would then use these as inspiration for the quilt and later go to the shop by myself to get more fabric that would match. She came up with this combination of fabrics.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"550\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/quilting-clenpot\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/signal-2022-07-22-1412161-1024x550.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-159\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost\/quilting-clenpot\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/signal-2022-07-22-1412161-1024x550.jpeg 1024w, http:\/\/localhost\/quilting-clenpot\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/signal-2022-07-22-1412161-300x161.jpeg 300w, http:\/\/localhost\/quilting-clenpot\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/signal-2022-07-22-1412161-768x413.jpeg 768w, http:\/\/localhost\/quilting-clenpot\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/signal-2022-07-22-1412161-1536x826.jpeg 1536w, http:\/\/localhost\/quilting-clenpot\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/signal-2022-07-22-1412161.jpeg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>With a cream background the light blue dark teal and pink would be the main colours with either the red, mustard or both as highlights dotted around.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next challenge was making a pattern that was modern looking and worked with these fabrics. I knew that I needed a decent amount of cream background and the orangey highlights but matching two very light colours, the blue and the pink with the teal was proving difficult. I went through a lot of iterations of the pattern but ended up with this.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"652\" height=\"654\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/quilting-clenpot\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/signal-2022-04-13-135221_001.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-160\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost\/quilting-clenpot\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/signal-2022-04-13-135221_001.png 652w, http:\/\/localhost\/quilting-clenpot\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/signal-2022-04-13-135221_001-300x300.png 300w, http:\/\/localhost\/quilting-clenpot\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/signal-2022-04-13-135221_001-150x150.png 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 652px) 100vw, 652px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The main block is called hidden star and I added extra diamonds around the edge of each block to make them look like diamonds, this also made room for the mustard highlight squares. The block I used is traditional, but I felt like with the colour scheme and the colour placement it could pass for a modern quilt.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have been practising my free-motion quilting in preparation for this quilt and was excited to get started on the quilting once all the piecing was completed. As a note, the backing fabric that Gabby and I chose was spectacular, I had a hard time obtaining enough of it, and it was expensive but well worth it. The fabric was called Time &amp; Tide Sea Flower Ocean Fabric by the designer Shell Rummel. After much deliberation and drawing quilting designs on numerous to scale paper copies of the block, I ended up with a design I liked and quilting it on all the blocks. All the quilting is done free-hand with the occasional marking of points so that I could obtain a good consistent design, for example for the squares I marked where each line coming from the centre would end so that I had somewhere to aim for. On the white background, I opted for a large wibbly-wobbly all-over design. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/quilting-clenpot\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/P5260007copy-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-161\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost\/quilting-clenpot\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/P5260007copy-1024x768.jpg 1024w, http:\/\/localhost\/quilting-clenpot\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/P5260007copy-300x225.jpg 300w, http:\/\/localhost\/quilting-clenpot\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/P5260007copy-768x576.jpg 768w, http:\/\/localhost\/quilting-clenpot\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/P5260007copy-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, http:\/\/localhost\/quilting-clenpot\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/P5260007copy-2048x1536.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-1 is-layout-flex\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" data-id=\"162\"  src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/quilting-clenpot\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/P5260009copy-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-162\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost\/quilting-clenpot\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/P5260009copy-1024x768.jpg 1024w, http:\/\/localhost\/quilting-clenpot\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/P5260009copy-300x225.jpg 300w, http:\/\/localhost\/quilting-clenpot\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/P5260009copy-768x576.jpg 768w, http:\/\/localhost\/quilting-clenpot\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/P5260009copy-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, http:\/\/localhost\/quilting-clenpot\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/P5260009copy-2048x1536.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" data-id=\"163\"  src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/quilting-clenpot\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/P5260008copy-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-163\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost\/quilting-clenpot\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/P5260008copy-1024x768.jpg 1024w, http:\/\/localhost\/quilting-clenpot\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/P5260008copy-300x225.jpg 300w, http:\/\/localhost\/quilting-clenpot\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/P5260008copy-768x576.jpg 768w, http:\/\/localhost\/quilting-clenpot\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/P5260008copy-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, http:\/\/localhost\/quilting-clenpot\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/P5260008copy-2048x1536.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n<\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I made a quilt years ago for my friend Gabby\u2019s 18th birthday.
