I got the idea for this quilt from the book \u201cFree-Motion Quilting with Angela Walters\u201d the quilt is called Housing Project and was designed and pieced by Scott Hansen and quilted by Angela. I had previously practised some of the quilting designs from this book on pieces of scraps and quilted some eggs for easter bunting. I felt like I was ready to move onto trying to quilt something larger and hoped that my sewing machine was up for the challenge and had enough throat space for an almost double bed sized quilt.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/quilting-clenpot\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/eggs-564x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-105\" width=\"282\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost\/quilting-clenpot\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/eggs-564x1024.jpeg 564w, http:\/\/localhost\/quilting-clenpot\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/eggs-165x300.jpeg 165w, http:\/\/localhost\/quilting-clenpot\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/eggs.jpeg 756w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 282px) 100vw, 282px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I decided on 12 inch log cabins to practise my all over designs. I have heard other quilters say that when quilting large pieces on a domestic quilt they often break it up into 12 inch squares and quilt these one at a time. I sort my scraps by size, so the bag labelled \u201cstrips\u201d came out for making the log cabin blocks, I used these along with some wider strips that I cut with some of my favourite fabrics from my stash to help the blocks go together faster. I often find myself with an odd mix of fabrics that do not necessarily \u201cgo with\u201d many other fabrics so something like this where anything goes it was the perfect opportunity for me to use them. I let my partner choose the plain fabrics that I was to use for the smaller sections, letting others choose fabric for me forces me to match colours that are not natural for me to match. He choose a light blue and a sand yellow which reminded me of the beach.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the yellow and blue sections I choose one design for each and stuck with them throughout the quilt. I wanted two designs that I would try to master by the time I had finished. For the yellow I choose feathers, this design includes travelling and echoing and requires a steady hand. I struggled to get my travelling lines to sit directly on my previously quilted line and found the weight of the quilt difficult to manage, the weight kept pulling me off course. I experimented with quilting with my feed-dogs up instead of down the had tension settings set to what I usually use for piecing and just changed my stich length to 0. I found that this stabilised the quilt and made my quilting lines more consistent and smoother. For the blue sections I used a geometric pattern that required quilting with a ruler I liked the pattern but found quilting with a ruler difficult due to the size of the quilt, when I practised on smaller pieces, I found it much easier. By the end I tried to free hand most of the straight lines but because they were spaced out and long this was quite tricky. If I did this design again, I would try to free hand it and do it smaller and in smaller sections.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A lot of the all over designs that I quilted on the log cabin blocks came from my Angela Walters book, I also did some designs from her recent FMQ Challenge \u201cfillers\u201d (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.quiltingismytherapy.com\/free-quilt-patterns-and-tutorials\/free-motion-challenge-quilting-along\/free-motion-fillers-free-motion-challenge-quilting-along\/page\/2\/\">https:\/\/www.quiltingismytherapy.com\/free-quilt-patterns-and-tutorials\/free-motion-challenge-quilting-along\/free-motion-fillers-free-motion-challenge-quilting-along\/page\/2\/<\/a>). I also tried some designs that I thought would look good on blocks that I might like to quilt in the future and some text. Two of my favourites are shown below, pebble variations and wavy swirls, I like the textures that these create, and they were not too hard to quilt.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-1 is-layout-flex\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" data-id=\"67\"  src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/quilting-clenpot\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/bubbles-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-67\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost\/quilting-clenpot\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/bubbles-1024x768.jpg 1024w, http:\/\/localhost\/quilting-clenpot\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/bubbles-300x225.jpg 300w, http:\/\/localhost\/quilting-clenpot\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/bubbles-768x576.jpg 768w, http:\/\/localhost\/quilting-clenpot\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/bubbles-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, http:\/\/localhost\/quilting-clenpot\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/bubbles-2048x1536.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption>Bubbles<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" data-id=\"68\"  src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/quilting-clenpot\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/wavySwirls-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-68\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost\/quilting-clenpot\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/wavySwirls-1024x768.jpg 1024w, http:\/\/localhost\/quilting-clenpot\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/wavySwirls-300x225.jpg 300w, http:\/\/localhost\/quilting-clenpot\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/wavySwirls-768x576.jpg 768w, http:\/\/localhost\/quilting-clenpot\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/wavySwirls-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, http:\/\/localhost\/quilting-clenpot\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/wavySwirls-2048x1536.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption>Wavy Swirls<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The backing of the quilt is a beautiful cirtus fruit print, I had to add the green polka-dot because there was not quilt enough yet on the roll at the shop.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/quilting-clenpot\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/backing-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-71\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost\/quilting-clenpot\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/backing-768x1024.jpg 768w, http:\/\/localhost\/quilting-clenpot\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/backing-225x300.jpg 225w, http:\/\/localhost\/quilting-clenpot\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/backing-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, http:\/\/localhost\/quilting-clenpot\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/backing-1536x2048.jpg 1536w, http:\/\/localhost\/quilting-clenpot\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/backing.jpg 1671w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" \/><\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I wanted to make a quilt to practise my free motion quilting, specifically I wanted large areas to practise all over designs along with some<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":66,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[5],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/quilting-clenpot\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/65"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/quilting-clenpot\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/quilting-clenpot\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/quilting-clenpot\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/quilting-clenpot\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=65"}],"version-history":[{"count":6,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/quilting-clenpot\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/65\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":126,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/quilting-clenpot\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/65\/revisions\/126"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/quilting-clenpot\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/66"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/quilting-clenpot\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=65"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/quilting-clenpot\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=65"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/quilting-clenpot\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=65"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
