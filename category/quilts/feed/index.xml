<p>This quilt I made for a new bairn. It was the first quilt I had made in quite a while and I didn&#8217;t have many fabrics but my partner bought me some pink and blue fabrics from lidl and then I found a yellow fabric to brighten it up some more. Because I hadn&#8217;t quilted in quite a bit I wanted to do a sampler type quilt so I could get back into making lots of different patchwork blocks, lots of my old favourites, the churn dash and the </p>

<p>This quilt I made for a young girl who loves unicorns. The unicorn is a pattern by Elizabeth Hartman <a href="https://elizabethhartman.com/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://elizabethhartman.com/">https://elizabethhartman.com/</a> and I added some starts and some squares of unicorn fabric to make it bigger along with a nice border of rainbow stary fabric. I found a lovely line of unicorn fabric called Believe by Kim Schaefer and found fabrics from my stash and from the shop to go with them. The finished size is around a meter square. It&#8217;s not possible to tell from the photo but the horn is done with glittery fabric!</p>



<p>I quilted this quilt using stich in the ditch around the unicorn and the star boarder then added some machined stars in navy on the background for extra security. The backing fabric is a super vibrant flowery print which I really didn&#8217;t buy enough of so had to do a few joins to make it work but it was definately worth it.</p>

<p>I wanted to make a quilt to practise my free motion quilting, specifically I wanted large areas to practice all over designs along with some smaller areas. I got the idea for this quilt from the book “Free-Motion Quilting with Angela Walters” the quilt is called Housing Project and was designed and pieced by Scott Hansen and quilted by Angela.</p>



<p>Below are two of my favourite blocks</p>

<p>A colourful single bed sized quilt made from 2.5 inch square scraps. Even though the design was simple I could never get board working with fabrics that are so bright and varied, it was a joy to make.</p>



<p>My Mum has a box of scraps cut into 2.5” squares and sorted by colour. I thought a checkerboard design would add some consistency to the vast quantity of random colours so together we matched the squares into pairs of fabric that would complement each other. Choosing fabrics that go together is one of my favourite things about quilting and with scraps it is even more exciting. Every piece has a story as all the fabrics have been pre-used. While matching them up my mum and I reminisced about old quilts that she had made with the fabrics, items of clothes that they had come from or the specific fabric shop that we had bought the fabric from. of choice when matching up the fabrics, they may not go well together but with scraps there may not be other options and I like been forced to use colours that I would not usually put together, it is very exciting. Below are some of my favourite blocks.</p>

<p>We went to the shop to buy the boarder colour and with this sort of quilt I would usually go for a navy with goes with everything and makes the bright colours really pop. However the pink is incredible, it simultaneously blends into the background and enhances the colours, I think it’s because it’s a warm mid-tone, a light or dark colour would make the blocks stand out individually while this makes the quilt one tying the blocks together. What also helps to tie the blocks together is this amazing circle boarder fabric, it contains most of the colours in the blocks but contains more warm colours than cold which makes it again blend in with the pick boarder and not distract from the blocks.</p>



<p>I quilted the quilt by doing little embroideries in some corners. I found a different stich to do in each place which was fun to do and good practise for me. Here are two of my favourites, a flower and a chain stich swirl.</p>
