<p>I enjoyed making my free motion quilted log cabin quilt and wanted another quilt to practise more FMQ on! I chose to make large &#8220;right and left&#8221; blocks as this block as a big square of empty space in the middle which would be perfect for practising. For the centre square of the blocks, I chose a plain fabric so that my quilting would stand out more.</p>



<p>I made some green, blue and pick blocks and started to lay them out to see how they would go together. This quilt would be a &#8220;quilt as you go&#8221; quilt  to use up some of my wadding scraps and also to see if I liked the idea of &#8220;quilt as you go&#8221;. The benefit of quilt as you go is that you can quilt on much smaller sections of the quilt rather than the whole quilt, which can be good, especially if your machine has a small throat. However, the downside is you then have to sew together the finished bits which as well as being a faff on with all the layers you then have to hem the back seam. I decided that quilt as you go wasn&#8217;t really for me, but at least I tried it.</p>

<p>Once I figured out my design, I started to quilt. I followed Angela Walters &#8220;fillers&#8221; FMQ challenge to try out a good variety of different pattern.</p>

<p>Below is the quilt so far, I will be adding some flying geese down the side of each long edge of the quilt to make it a better size. I will then have to figure out how to quilt these!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[When I was a baby, I had a Japanese folded patchwork &#8220;circles into squares&#8221; quilt that my mother made me, it was all made of]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>When I was a baby, I had a Japanese folded patchwork &#8220;circles into squares&#8221; quilt that my mother made me, it was all made of blue and green batik fabrics as is beautiful. I thought I would make my own, as I wanted a long project and had the perfect fabric for it. I had spotted this rainbow Alison Glass collection called &#8220;Thicket&#8221; and asked my family if they might buy me the fabric bundle for my birthday so that I could make this quilt. To go with it, we picked out a bluey teal linen texture fabric that would act as the background fabric.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="360" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/signal-2023-06-22-120017_004copy-1024x360.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-231" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/signal-2023-06-22-120017_004copy-1024x360.jpeg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/06/signal-2023-06-22-120017_004copy-300x106.jpeg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/06/signal-2023-06-22-120017_004copy-768x270.jpeg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/06/signal-2023-06-22-120017_004copy-1536x540.jpeg 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/06/signal-2023-06-22-120017_004copy.jpeg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The fabrics all lined up in order, ready to create an ombre quilt. Mostly from the Alison Glass collection, but a few additions from my stash.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The squares would be 5&#8243; finished, giving me a good way of using up a load of wadding scraps that I had lying around from past quilts. The square would be made from coloured fabric and the circle from the blue linen texture backing fabric. I would use hand quilting thread for sewing, which is thicker than normal thread and also has a shine which helps the stitching stand out. I bought a rainbow of different colours of these threads and will be using a coloured thread that will match the inside square.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/signal-2023-06-22-133001_002-1024x768.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-232" width="429" height="321" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/signal-2023-06-22-133001_002-1024x768.jpeg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/06/signal-2023-06-22-133001_002-300x225.jpeg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/06/signal-2023-06-22-133001_002-768x576.jpeg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/06/signal-2023-06-22-133001_002-1536x1152.jpeg 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/06/signal-2023-06-22-133001_002.jpeg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 429px) 100vw, 429px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">My practise block now hangs on my sewing peg board</figcaption></figure>



<p>I played around with different ombre designs on my computer to try to come up with the design my requirements were that the quilt needed to fit on a double bed so no less than 75 inches square which would be 15 by 15 blocks. Another requirement was to use all the fabrics in my pile.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="240" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Untitled1-1024x240.png" alt="" class="wp-image-233" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Untitled1-1024x240.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Untitled1-300x70.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Untitled1-768x180.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Untitled1-1536x360.png 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Untitled1-2048x480.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Some different ideas about layout</figcaption></figure>



<p>In the end, I decided to do a zigzag design. I had too many fabrics to simply have one line of zigzag for each colour, so would need to change colour part way along the zigzag. To get the right ratio of each colour, I figured out how many blocks I would need (256) and then planned how many blocks of each fabric I would use based on how many other fabrics of similar colour I had. For example, I had a lot of greens of a similar shade so would only cut 6 blocks of each green fabric, however I didn&#8217;t have many different yellows so might need 15 blocks of the same fabric.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1012" height="620" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/squares1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-235" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/squares1.png 1012w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/06/squares1-300x184.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/06/squares1-768x471.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1012px) 100vw, 1012px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">My plan includes the number of squares of each fabric and how they will be laid out.</figcaption></figure>



<p>This will be a long project, but I am nearly a quarter of the way though and so far it is looking stunning. It will be well worth the effort when it is completed and on the bed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I made a quilt years ago for my friend Gabby’s 18<sup>th</sup> birthday. It was a Japanese-inspired quilt made of fabric panels of geisha and large blocks made from Japanese fabric. She loves it, but it is an odd shape and does not fit the double bed she now has. I offered to make her and her fiancée a new one and hoped to have it ready in time for a wedding present. I hoped to combine all the quilting skills I have developed to make a masterpiece.</p>



<p>Gabby and I made a joint Pinterest board, this was so that I could see what sort of quilt she might like. The general ideas that I took from the board was a that Gabby wanted a light coloured, modern quilt with reasonably plain fabrics and not too many different colours. A few examples of quilts on the board are these 3 from Suzy Quilts, the thrive quilt <a href="https://suzyquilts.com/shop/thrive-quilt-pattern-download/">https://suzyquilts.com/shop/thrive-quilt-pattern-download/</a>, the new horizons quilt <a href="https://suzyquilts.com/shop/new-horizons-quilt-pattern-download/">https://suzyquilts.com/shop/new-horizons-quilt-pattern-download/</a> and an ombre quilt <a href="https://suzyquilts.com/create-an-ombre-quilt-with-fat-quarters/">https://suzyquilts.com/create-an-ombre-quilt-with-fat-quarters/</a>. I would say that I was more of a traditional quilter so looked forward to the challenge of trying a more modern quilt.</p>



<p>I would have liked to take Gabby to the fabric shop while she was up visiting, but we just didn’t have time, so I got her to pick some fabrics from my stash. I would then use these as inspiration for the quilt and later go to the shop by myself to get more fabric that would match. She came up with this combination of fabrics.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="550" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/signal-2022-07-22-1412161-1024x550.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-159" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/signal-2022-07-22-1412161-1024x550.jpeg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/06/signal-2022-07-22-1412161-300x161.jpeg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/06/signal-2022-07-22-1412161-768x413.jpeg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/06/signal-2022-07-22-1412161-1536x826.jpeg 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/06/signal-2022-07-22-1412161.jpeg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>With a cream background the light blue dark teal and pink would be the main colours with either the red, mustard or both as highlights dotted around.</p>



<p>The next challenge was making a pattern that was modern looking and worked with these fabrics. I knew that I needed a decent amount of cream background and the orangey highlights but matching two very light colours, the blue and the pink with the teal was proving difficult. I went through a lot of iterations of the pattern but ended up with this.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="652" height="654" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/signal-2022-04-13-135221_001.png" alt="" class="wp-image-160" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/signal-2022-04-13-135221_001.png 652w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/06/signal-2022-04-13-135221_001-300x300.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/06/signal-2022-04-13-135221_001-150x150.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 652px) 100vw, 652px" /></figure>



<p>The main block is called hidden star and I added extra diamonds around the edge of each block to make them look like diamonds, this also made room for the mustard highlight squares. The block I used is traditional, but I felt like with the colour scheme and the colour placement it could pass for a modern quilt.</p>

<p>I have been practising my free-motion quilting in preparation for this quilt and was excited to get started on the quilting once all the piecing was completed. As a side note, the backing fabric that Gabby and I chose was spectacular, I had a hard time obtaining enough of it, and it was expensive but well worth it. The fabric was called Time &amp; Tide Sea Flower Ocean Fabric by the designer Shell Rummel. After much deliberation and drawing quilting designs on numerous photo copies of my plan and to scale paper copies of the block, I ended up with a design I liked and quilting it on all the blocks. I decided to leave the dark blue plain and only quilt on the lighter colours.</p>

<p>All the quilting is done free-hand with the occasional marking of points so that I could obtain a good consistent design, for example for the squares I marked where each line coming from the centre would end so that I had somewhere to aim for. On the white background, I opted for a large wibbly-wobbly all-over design. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I decided to start on an English paper piecing project to have some hand sewing to do whilst travelling or watching the television. I wanted to do large hexagons which would all fit together nicely, but not all be the same design. Different designs would be more interesting for me to sew, and I could learn more by doing different designs. After ordering some triangular graph paper, I set to work on some designs.</p>

<p>This quilt will be made solely out of scraps as the pieces are small, it is the perfect project for scraps. My idea for the final quilt is that it will be quite a hodgepodge of different fabrics as I am not going to abide by any colour scheme, anything goes! This quilt will probably take a lifetime, but I don&#8217;t mind too much about that.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I always fancied making a space quilt, I loved space when I was a child and when my friends gave birth to their 4th son I thought this would be the prefect opportunity. Surely 4 boys would love a space quilt, so a year later for his Christening it was finished.</p>



<p>I wanted all 8 planets to feature in the quilt, sized to scale with each other and also the sun. As Mercury is the smallest, I set that to be around an inch or two and scaled the rest of the planets from that, using either a compass to get the curvature or a long piece of string with a pencil on the end. I also featured three rockets, for which I designed the block for myself and some fabric which had some facts about each planet which I appliquéd on close to each planet. The planets were appliquéd on using either bond-a-web or spray adhesive and then a zigzag stitch.</p>

<p>To quilt this quilt, I did a stitch in the ditch round each block and then added stars to the background of each block to hold everything in place. My sewing machine has the ability to sew stars, so I did them on the machine using a golden thread. The backing fabric is an incredible space print which is actually glow in the dark! An incredible find which hopefully the boys will enjoy as much as I did.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I have always admired these quilts; I love log cabins and to me the pineapple quilt just look like an extreme version of the log cabin. I knew it would take quite a while, it took me a whole year in the end, but since it was covid I had the time. Furthermore, I did not have much fabric back then as I was just getting back into quilting, however I was able to scrounge a lot of scraps from my mother.</p>



<p>To plan this quilt, I printed off a line drawing of the pineapple pattern with the navy-blue sections filled in and coloured in some ideas I had for colour placements. I ended up choosing a design with all the blocks being the same with the greens and blues opposite and the fabrics getting darker and darker as they got further from the centre. I laid out all my fabrics in 5 green piles and 5 blue piles, with each pile a different shade.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="463" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/signal-2022-09-08-0908431-1024x463.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-137" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/signal-2022-09-08-0908431-1024x463.jpeg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/06/signal-2022-09-08-0908431-300x136.jpeg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/06/signal-2022-09-08-0908431-768x348.jpeg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/06/signal-2022-09-08-0908431-1536x695.jpeg 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/06/signal-2022-09-08-0908431.jpeg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Organising fabrics! One of my fave route tasks</figcaption></figure>



<p>To make the blocks, I bought a pineapple trim tool from creative grids. I have never tried to make a pineapple block without the ruler, but I imagine that it would be a lot more difficult and take longer. I was impressed with how easy it is with the ruler and also how high a precision that can be achieved.</p>

</figure>



<p>When finished I got some lovely batik floral fabric for the backing that was on sale and after basting the layers together I hand tied the quilt in the corner of each block to hold it together, such a beautiful design could be ruined with over quilting and the knots are mostly invisible. This quilt now lives happily on our bed.</p>

<p>I saw this pattern on Elizabeth Hartman’s website (<a href="https://elizabethhartman.com/">https://elizabethhartman.com/</a>) and really wanted to try it. I knew it would be a challenge to piece and was quite excited because this would be the most complicated pattern that I had ever tried. Fortunately, there was a new baby due in the family soon so that gave me the perfect excuse. The parents preferred muted tones to the bright colours that I am used to making quilts from so I opted for more pastel colours with a background colour of linen texture green. I love working with the baby quilt prints, they are so much fun, I especially enjoyed making a T-Rex out of alien fabric with ducky legs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>This quilt was my first attempt at a scenic picture quilt, one day I hope to make a full size one. This one is just a wall hanging measuring about 80cm square, it really looks great on our wall!</p>



<p>To create this quilt, I drew the mountain out onto a grid of 1 inch squares half the size I wanted. I thought that basing the quilt off 2 inch squares would be manageable and would turn out around the size that I wanted. After drawing the mountain, I then adjusted the mountain to as much as possible consist of squares or half square triangles, this would make it much easier to piece. I did end up with some pieces consisting of half rectangle triangles and other irregular squares, but it wasn’t too many, so I just went with it. I used flying geese to depict the trees and 4 inch squares for the sky. I laid out the fabrics on the floor before sewing together so I could get the right colour arrangement before piecing.</p>



<p>For the quilting I did some tree shaped lines for the trees and grassy tufts for the grass hill, some close ups are shown below. The sky I did wobbly lines with a walking foot and the mountain free motion scribbles going the same way that the rock went.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>This quilt I made for my newly born niece. It was the first quilt I had made in quite a while, since I had moved to a new house I now had the space to start quilting again. I did not have many fabrics, but my partner bought me some pink and blue fabrics from Lidl and I then added some yellow fabric to them to brighten it up. Because I had not quilted for some time, I decided to do a sampler type quilt to get back into making lots of different patchwork blocks. Lots of my old favourite blocks, including churn dash and the old windmill. For the white background of the blocks, I used an old sheet, I wouldn’t recommend this as it was quite thin, and I wonder if it will stand the test of time.</p>

<p>All blocks were pieced except for the heart which I appliquéd. The blocks finish at 6 inches and were all from my favourite book &#8220;The New, Quick and Easy Block Tool!&#8221;. The house was by far the most difficult block as it has so many different pieces, I seemed to lose fabric to the seam allowance. Nothing some stretching with the iron and tactical seams can&#8217;t fix though!</p>



<p>For the bears, I drew them out first on paper to get the right size, then bond-a-webbed and appliquéd them onto the pillow fabric with a zigzag stitch. I hand sewed the eyes and mouths of the parents with a 6-strand embroidery thread. I like how the ear and bow fabrics of the bears appear in the blocks, and think the little pink bow was a nice touch.</p>

<p>This quilt I made for a young girl who loves unicorns. The unicorn is a pattern by Elizabeth Hartman (<a href="https://elizabethhartman.com/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://elizabethhartman.com/">https://elizabethhartman.com/</a>) and I added some star of hope 6 inch blocks and some squares of unicorn fabric to make it bigger along with a nice border of rainbow stary fabric. The finished size is around a metre square. It&#8217;s not possible to tell from the photo but the horn is done with glittery fabric! I found a lovely line of unicorn fabric called Believe by Kim Schaefer and found fabrics from my stash and from the shop to go with them. The photo below shows the star Believe fabric layed out with the fabrics I chose to do the unicorn mane in. The rainbow is fairly pastely and an interesting combination of colours, it was fun to find fabrics to go with it.</p>

<p>Some of my favourite fabrics in this quilt include a blue fabric with rainbows and a constellation pink fabric. I thought these were quite appropriate for a unicorn quilt and hope that the owner enjoys them as much as I did. I wonder if they will see something different in the quilt every time they snuggle under it, I like to try to hide little things in quilts which can&#8217;t be seen unless you really look at it deeply.</p>



<p>I quilted this quilt using stich in the ditch around the unicorn and the star border then added some machined stars in navy on the background for extra security. The backing fabric is a super vibrant flowery print which I really didn&#8217;t buy enough of so had to do a few joins to make it work but it was definitely worth it.</p>
