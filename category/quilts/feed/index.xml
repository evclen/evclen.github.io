										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I made a quilt years ago for my friend Gabby’s 18<sup>th</sup> birthday. It was a Japanese-inspired quilt made of fabric panels of geisha and large blocks made from Japanese fabric. She loves it, but it is an odd shape and does not fit the double bed she now has. I offered to make her and her fiancée a new one and hoped to have it ready in time for a wedding present. I hoped to combine all the quilting skills I have developed to make a masterpiece.</p>



<p>Gabby and I made a joint Pinterest board, this was so that I could see what sort of quilt she might like. The general ideas that I took from the board was a that Gabby wanted a light coloured, modern quilt with reasonably plain fabrics and not too many different colours. A few examples of quilts on the board are these 3 from Suzy Quilts, the thrive quilt <a href="https://suzyquilts.com/shop/thrive-quilt-pattern-download/">https://suzyquilts.com/shop/thrive-quilt-pattern-download/</a>, the new horizons quilt <a href="https://suzyquilts.com/shop/new-horizons-quilt-pattern-download/">https://suzyquilts.com/shop/new-horizons-quilt-pattern-download/</a> and an ombre quilt <a href="https://suzyquilts.com/create-an-ombre-quilt-with-fat-quarters/">https://suzyquilts.com/create-an-ombre-quilt-with-fat-quarters/</a>. I would say that I was more of a traditional quilter so looked forward to the challenge of trying a more modern quilt.</p>



<p>I would have liked to take Gabby to the fabric shop while she was up visiting, but we just didn’t have time, so I got her to pick some fabrics from my stash. I would then use these as inspiration for the quilt and later go to the shop by myself to get more fabric that would match. She came up with this combination of fabrics.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="550" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/signal-2022-07-22-1412161-1024x550.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-159" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/signal-2022-07-22-1412161-1024x550.jpeg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/06/signal-2022-07-22-1412161-300x161.jpeg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/06/signal-2022-07-22-1412161-768x413.jpeg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/06/signal-2022-07-22-1412161-1536x826.jpeg 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/06/signal-2022-07-22-1412161.jpeg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>With a cream background the light blue dark teal and pink would be the main colours with either the red, mustard or both as highlights dotted around.</p>



<p>The next challenge was making a pattern that was modern looking and worked with these fabrics. I knew that I needed a decent amount of cream background and the orangey highlights but matching two very light colours, the blue and the pink with the teal was proving difficult. I went through a lot of iterations of the pattern but ended up with this.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="652" height="654" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/signal-2022-04-13-135221_001.png" alt="" class="wp-image-160" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/signal-2022-04-13-135221_001.png 652w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/06/signal-2022-04-13-135221_001-300x300.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/06/signal-2022-04-13-135221_001-150x150.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 652px) 100vw, 652px" /></figure>



<p>The main block is called hidden star and I added extra diamonds around the edge of each block to make them look like diamonds, this also made room for the mustard highlight squares. The block I used is traditional, but I felt like with the colour scheme and the colour placement it could pass for a modern quilt.</p>

<p>I have been practising my free-motion quilting in preparation for this quilt and was excited to get started on the quilting once all the piecing was completed. As a side note, the backing fabric that Gabby and I chose was spectacular, I had a hard time obtaining enough of it, and it was expensive but well worth it. The fabric was called Time &amp; Tide Sea Flower Ocean Fabric by the designer Shell Rummel. After much deliberation and drawing quilting designs on numerous photo copies of my plan and to scale paper copies of the block, I ended up with a design I liked and quilting it on all the blocks. I decided to leave the dark blue plain and only quilt on the lighter colours.</p>

<p>All the quilting is done free-hand with the occasional marking of points so that I could obtain a good consistent design, for example for the squares I marked where each line coming from the centre would end so that I had somewhere to aim for. On the white background, I opted for a large wibbly-wobbly all-over design. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I always fancied making a space quilt, I loved space when I was a child and when my friends gave birth to their 4th son I thought this would be the prefect opportunity. Surely 4 boys would love a space quilt, so a year later for his Christening it was finished.</p>



<p>I wanted all 8 planets to feature in the quilt, sized to scale with each other and also the sun. As Mercury is the smallest, I set that to be around an inch or two and scaled the rest of the planets from that, using either a compass to get the curvature or a long piece of string with a pencil on the end. I also featured three rockets, for which I designed the block for myself and some fabric which had some facts about each planet which I appliquéd on close to each planet. The planets were appliquéd on using either bond-a-web or spray adhesive and then a zigzag stitch.</p>

<p>To quilt this quilt, I did a stitch in the ditch round each block and then added stars to the background of each block to hold everything in place. My sewing machine has the ability to sew stars, so I did them on the machine using a golden thread. The backing fabric is an incredible space print which is actually glow in the dark! An incredible find which hopefully the boys will enjoy as much as I did.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I have always admired these quilts; I love log cabins and to me the pineapple quilt just look like an extreme version of the log cabin. I knew it would take quite a while, it took me a whole year in the end, but since it was covid I had the time. Furthermore, I did not have much fabric back then as I was just getting back into quilting, however I was able to scrounge a lot of scraps from my mother.</p>



<p>To plan this quilt, I printed off a line drawing of the pineapple pattern with the navy-blue sections filled in and coloured in some ideas I had for colour placements. I ended up choosing a design with all the blocks being the same with the greens and blues opposite and the fabrics getting darker and darker as they got further from the centre. I laid out all my fabrics in 5 green piles and 5 blue piles, with each pile a different shade.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="463" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/signal-2022-09-08-0908431-1024x463.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-137" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/signal-2022-09-08-0908431-1024x463.jpeg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/06/signal-2022-09-08-0908431-300x136.jpeg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/06/signal-2022-09-08-0908431-768x348.jpeg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/06/signal-2022-09-08-0908431-1536x695.jpeg 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/06/signal-2022-09-08-0908431.jpeg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Organising fabrics! One of my fave route tasks</figcaption></figure>



<p>To make the blocks, I bought a pineapple trim tool from creative grids. I have never tried to make a pineapple block without the ruler, but I imagine that it would be a lot more difficult and take longer. I was impressed with how easy it is with the ruler and also how high a precision that can be achieved.</p>

</figure>



<p>When finished I got some lovely batik floral fabric for the backing that was on sale and after basting the layers together I hand tied the quilt in the corner of each block to hold it together, such a beautiful design could be ruined with over quilting and the knots are mostly invisible. This quilt now lives happily on our bed.</p>

<p>I saw this pattern on Elizabeth Hartman’s website (<a href="https://elizabethhartman.com/">https://elizabethhartman.com/</a>) and really wanted to try it. I knew it would be a challenge to piece and was quite excited because this would be the most complicated pattern that I had ever tried. Fortunately, there was a new baby due in the family soon so that gave me the perfect excuse. The parents preferred muted tones to the bright colours that I am used to making quilts from so I opted for more pastel colours with a background colour of linen texture green. I love working with the baby quilt prints, they are so much fun, I especially enjoyed making a T-Rex out of alien fabric with ducky legs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>This quilt was my first attempt at a scenic picture quilt, one day I hope to make a full size one. This one is just a wall hanging measuring about 80cm square, it really looks great on our wall!</p>



<p>To create this quilt, I drew the mountain out onto a grid of 1 inch squares half the size I wanted. I thought that basing the quilt off 2 inch squares would be manageable and would turn out around the size that I wanted. After drawing the mountain, I then adjusted the mountain to as much as possible consist of squares or half square triangles, this would make it much easier to piece. I did end up with some pieces consisting of half rectangle triangles and other irregular squares, but it wasn’t too many, so I just went with it. I used flying geese to depict the trees and 4 inch squares for the sky. I laid out the fabrics on the floor before sewing together so I could get the right colour arrangement before piecing.</p>



<p>For the quilting I did some tree shaped lines for the trees and grassy tufts for the grass hill, some close ups are shown below. The sky I did wobbly lines with a walking foot and the mountain free motion scribbles going the same way that the rock went.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>This quilt I made for my newly born niece. It was the first quilt I had made in quite a while, since I had moved to a new house I now had the space to start quilting again. I did not have many fabrics, but my partner bought me some pink and blue fabrics from Lidl and I then added some yellow fabric to them to brighten it up. Because I had not quilted for some time, I decided to do a sampler type quilt to get back into making lots of different patchwork blocks. Lots of my old favourite blocks, including churn dash and the old windmill. For the white background of the blocks, I used an old sheet, I wouldn’t recommend this as it was quite thin, and I wonder if it will stand the test of time.</p>

<p>All blocks were pieced except for the heart which I appliquéd. The blocks finish at 6 inches and were all from my favourite book &#8220;The New, Quick and Easy Block Tool!&#8221;. The house was by far the most difficult block as it has so many different pieces, I seemed to lose fabric to the seam allowance. Nothing some stretching with the iron and tactical seams can&#8217;t fix though!</p>



<p>For the bears, I drew them out first on paper to get the right size, then bond-a-webbed and appliquéd them onto the pillow fabric with a zigzag stitch. I hand sewed the eyes and mouths of the parents with a 6-strand embroidery thread. I like how the ear and bow fabrics of the bears appear in the blocks, and think the little pink bow was a nice touch.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>This quilt I made for a young girl who loves unicorns. The unicorn is a pattern by Elizabeth Hartman (<a href="https://elizabethhartman.com/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://elizabethhartman.com/">https://elizabethhartman.com/</a>) and I added some star of hope 6 inch blocks and some squares of unicorn fabric to make it bigger along with a nice border of rainbow stary fabric. The finished size is around a metre square. It&#8217;s not possible to tell from the photo but the horn is done with glittery fabric! I found a lovely line of unicorn fabric called Believe by Kim Schaefer and found fabrics from my stash and from the shop to go with them. The photo below shows the star Believe fabric layed out with the fabrics I chose to do the unicorn mane in. The rainbow is fairly pastely and an interesting combination of colours, it was fun to find fabrics to go with it.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/unicorn-fabric-1024x1024.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-134" width="512" height="512" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/unicorn-fabric-1024x1024.jpeg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/07/unicorn-fabric-300x300.jpeg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/07/unicorn-fabric-150x150.jpeg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/07/unicorn-fabric-768x768.jpeg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/07/unicorn-fabric-1536x1536.jpeg 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/07/unicorn-fabric-800x800.jpeg 800w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/07/unicorn-fabric.jpeg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></figure>



<p>Some of my favourite fabrics in this quilt include a blue fabric with rainbows and a constellation pink fabric. I thought these were quite appropriate for a unicorn quilt and hope that the owner enjoys them as much as I did. I wonder if they will see something different in the quilt every time they snuggle under it, I like to try to hide little things in quilts which can&#8217;t be seen unless you really look at it deeply.</p>



<p>I quilted this quilt using stich in the ditch around the unicorn and the star border then added some machined stars in navy on the background for extra security. The backing fabric is a super vibrant flowery print which I really didn&#8217;t buy enough of so had to do a few joins to make it work but it was definitely worth it.</p>

<p>I wanted to make a quilt to practise my free motion quilting, specifically I wanted large areas to practise all over designs along with some smaller areas. I got the idea for this quilt from the book “Free-Motion Quilting with Angela Walters” the quilt is called Housing Project and was designed and pieced by Scott Hansen and quilted by Angela. I had previously practised some of the quilting designs from this book on pieces of scraps and quilted some eggs for easter bunting. I felt like I was ready to move onto trying to quilt something larger and hoped that my sewing machine was up for the challenge and had enough throat space for an almost double bed sized quilt.</p>

<p>I decided on 12 inch log cabins to practise my all over designs. I have heard other quilters say that when quilting large pieces on a domestic quilt they often break it up into 12 inch squares and quilt these one at a time. I sort my scraps by size, so the bag labelled “strips” came out for making the log cabin blocks, I used these along with some wider strips that I cut with some of my favourite fabrics from my stash to help the blocks go together faster. I often find myself with an odd mix of fabrics that do not necessarily “go with” many other fabrics so something like this where anything goes it was the perfect opportunity for me to use them. I let my partner choose the plain fabrics that I was to use for the smaller sections, letting others choose fabric for me forces me to match colours that are not natural for me to match. He choose a light blue and a sand yellow which reminded me of the beach.</p>



<p>For the yellow and blue sections I choose one design for each and stuck with them throughout the quilt. I wanted two designs that I would try to master by the time I had finished. For the yellow I choose feathers, this design includes travelling and echoing and requires a steady hand. I struggled to get my travelling lines to sit directly on my previously quilted line and found the weight of the quilt difficult to manage, the weight kept pulling me off course. I experimented with quilting with my feed-dogs up instead of down the had tension settings set to what I usually use for piecing and just changed my stich length to 0. I found that this stabilised the quilt and made my quilting lines more consistent and smoother. For the blue sections I used a geometric pattern that required quilting with a ruler I liked the pattern but found quilting with a ruler difficult due to the size of the quilt, when I practised on smaller pieces, I found it much easier. By the end I tried to free hand most of the straight lines but because they were spaced out and long this was quite tricky. If I did this design again, I would try to free hand it and do it smaller and in smaller sections.</p>



<p>A lot of the all over designs that I quilted on the log cabin blocks came from my Angela Walters book, I also did some designs from her recent FMQ Challenge “fillers” (<a href="https://www.quiltingismytherapy.com/free-quilt-patterns-and-tutorials/free-motion-challenge-quilting-along/free-motion-fillers-free-motion-challenge-quilting-along/page/2/">https://www.quiltingismytherapy.com/free-quilt-patterns-and-tutorials/free-motion-challenge-quilting-along/free-motion-fillers-free-motion-challenge-quilting-along/page/2/</a>). I also tried some designs that I thought would look good on blocks that I might like to quilt in the future and some text. Two of my favourites are shown below, pebble variations and wavy swirls, I like the textures that these create, and they were not too hard to quilt.</p>

<p>The backing of the quilt is a beautiful cirtus fruit print, I had to add the green polka-dot because there was not quilt enough yet on the roll at the shop.</p>

<p>A colourful single bed sized quilt made from 2.5 inch square scraps. Even though the design was simple I could never get bored working with fabrics that are so bright and varied, it was a joy to make.</p>



<p>My Mum has a box of scraps cut into 2.5” squares and sorted by colour. I thought a checkerboard design would add some consistency to the vast quantity of random colours so together we matched the squares into pairs of fabric that would complement each other. Choosing fabrics that go together is one of my favourite things about quilting and with scraps it is even more exciting. Every piece has a story as all the fabrics have been pre-used. While matching them up my mum and I reminisced about old quilts that she had made with the fabrics, items of clothes that they had come from or the specific fabric shop that we had bought the fabric from. of choice when matching up the fabrics, they may not go well together but with scraps there may not be other options and I like been forced to use colours that I would not usually put together, it is very exciting. Below are some of my favourite blocks.</p>

<p>We went to the shop to buy the border colour and with this sort of quilt I would usually go for a navy with goes with everything and makes the bright colours really pop. However the pink is incredible, it simultaneously blends into the background and enhances the colours, I think it’s because it’s a warm mid-tone, a light or dark colour would make the blocks stand out individually while this makes the quilt one tying the blocks together. What also helps to tie the blocks together is this amazing circle border fabric, it contains most of the colours in the blocks but contains more warm colours than cold which makes it again blend in with the pick border and not distract from the blocks.</p>



<p>I quilted the quilt by doing little embroideries in some corners. I found a different stich to do in each place which was fun to do and good practise for me. Here are two of my favourites, a flower and a chain stich swirl.</p>
